## Development

[enigma](https://github.com/abigger87/enigma) is intended to be minimal while also providing backwards compatibility. Thus, both [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry) are supported. Installation instructions for both are included below.
#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

🎉 Foundry is installed! 🎉

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.
